# Avi's books
This is a project I'm starting for my daughter, Avi. She loves to write books, and I wanted to bring that to life in a website she can share her stories on. 

## What I'm using
I'm starting off with a MEN stack, MongoDB, Express, and Node.js. 

## Goals
I'd love for this to be a place for Avi to log in, write a blog post or short story, and display her individual books for her and others to read.
